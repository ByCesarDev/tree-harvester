## **What Does Tree Harvester Do?**

With the **Tree Harvester** addon, you can fell entire trees by simply **crouching** and using an **axe** on the trunk. All connected logs and leaves are broken automatically, making the harvesting process faster and more efficient.

## **Key Features**

- ✅ Quickly harvest entire trees by crouching and using an axe.  
- ✅ Supports standard trees, custom trees, and Nether trees.  
- ✅ Configurable break speed to balance performance and efficiency.  
- ✅ Supports Silk Touch axes for leaf collection.  
- ✅ Compatible with custom logs and leaves from other addons.

## **Practical Examples**

🔹 You want to clear a forest quickly â€” just crouch and use your axe on any tree to instantly fell it.  
🔹 You need Nether resources â€” warped and crimson trees are supported when Nether trees are enabled.

## **Why Use Tree Harvester?**

✔️ Speeds up tree harvesting dramatically.  
✔️ Makes resource gathering much easier for crafting and building.  
✔️ Works with a wide range of trees including custom and Nether varieties.

## **Configurable**

You can configure the addon directly in the script file located at:  
`com.mojang/behavior_packs/Tree Harvester BP/scripts/main.js` (lines 118-121)

- **`breakSpeed`**: Sets the speed (in milliseconds) at which blocks break. Default is `2`. Lower = faster but may reduce performance.  
- **`customLogsAndLeaves`**: `true` (default) allows harvesting of custom blocks ending in `_log` or `_leaves`. Set to `false` to disable.  
- **`enableNetherTrees`**: `true` (default) enables harvesting of Nether trees (e.g. warped/crimson). Set to `false` to disable.

## **How to Install**

1. Download and install the addon.  
2. Enable the addon (behavior pack) in your world settings.  
3. Equip an axe, crouch, and interact with any tree.  
4. Make sure experimental gameplay features are enabled in your world settings.

## **Compatibility**

✅ Compatible with most addons unless they alter block breaking or player interaction systems.  
✅ Fully works in normal worlds and realms.

## **Addon Packs**

You can include this addon in public or private addon packs. Please do **not** re-upload it to other websites without permission. Always credit the original **CurseForge** or **MCPEDL** page when sharing.
